### How to use GitHub
---
So I've already went through the instruction on setting up an account on GitHub and installing GitHub Desktop. Ask me again if you need to know how to set it up again.

Creating and maintaining your own branch isn't necessary for our project but it's a useful skill to have.

For committing your code to the master branch, on top where it says "Compare," near there, you should see other branches if available. For now you should see nothing, which means you can commit to master.

In the "Summary" field, write something reflecting the changes you've made. Hit "commit to master." This is also another way to know if you are in the master branch, it'll say that instead of the name of the branch you're on.

So that's all there is to it. Just code and commit as you feel is needed. If you don't commit, none of us will see it.

### Understanding the Python code

I will get around to writing it on Wednesday (2/8) or so.
